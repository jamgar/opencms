# OpenCMS

This is a SPA created without a JavaScript Framework. I used the project to challenge myself and strengthen my foundation of JavaScript. I am sure there are many areas of the code that can be refactored and/or cleaned up. It was a great learning experience and I hope you can get some inspiration from it and build upon this project.
